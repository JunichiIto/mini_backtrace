= MiniBacktrace

A minimal backtrace filter for MiniTest::Unit & Rails. If you have been using Rails 3 with Ruby 1.9, that means your test base test library is MiniTest::Unit. But since Rails 3 there have been no backtrace silencers included in ActiveSupport for the ActiveSupport::BacktraceCleaner (aka Rails.backtrace_cleaner) to hook into MiniTest::Unit. That means noisy tests.



= Install
